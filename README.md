# Flow

Flow contains the universal [typings](/src/typings/namespace.d.ts) and basic layout of how a `.flow` file should be structured and defined.

## Examples
- [Minimal file](src/examples/minimalFile.ts) (the most minimal .flow data structure you could have)
- [Basic file](src/examples/basicFile.ts) (a data structure containing Screens and settings)
- [Basic file with Connections](src/examples/basicFileWithConnections.ts) (a data structure containing Screens connections to other nodes)


## Building a `.flow` file from the Basic structure

1.  Clone repo
2. `cd Flow`
3.  `yarn`
4.  `yarn run build` to build a .flow file
