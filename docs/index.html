            <h2>The Node</h2>
            <p>
                All visible elements in a Flow file are Nodes. The following
                properties are shared between all Nodes, which helps us
                differentiate it amongst the rest.
            </p>

            <h2>Node Types</h2>
            <p>
                Each Node has its own type and has a different hierarcy in the
                structure. Nodes vary all the way from the Document Node, to the
                Hotspot Node. Nodes have several different uniquely associated
                properties as well as common properties.
